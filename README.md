# DESCRIPTION
**Reverse engineered how CurseForge handles file downloads**, usually you have to download the 500 Mb enormous app just to install a mod pack, that has.json and.html. Well now, time has changed, no more storage stealing from CurseForge, and no more time wasting from CurseForge, you can now **insta(not insta, but FASTLY) download the mods** inside the modpack and add them to your Minecraft.

# HOW TO DOWNLOAD
In your **TERMINAL**, type in `"https://github.com/Sekai0NI0itamio/install-minecraft-modpacks.git"`, and hit enter.
NEXT, type in `"cd install-minecraft-modpacks"`, and hit enter.
Congrats, you have the python3 file.

# HOW TO USE
1. Type in `python3 curseforge.py` and hit enter.
2. Type in the name of your modpack folder (make sure the modpack folder is on the same directory as the script) then hit enter.
   - IF EVERYTHING IS CORRECT, you should see a **Tinker window** popup with the information about the game version, Fabric Forge information, and other stuff along with it, 
     - (this is important because you want to install the same version of the Fabric or Forge your modpack is in for your Minecraft instance).
   - TO START THE DOWNLOAD, CLOSE THE TINKER WINDOW BY HITTING THE "X" BUTTON.
3. ALL THE MODS ARE INSTALLED IN A FOLDER NAMED "MODS" OR "mods"(depends), and then all you have to do is wait until the program stops and quits.

# WHICH MINECRAFT LAUNCHER TO USE
I personally recommend **MultiMC**, it's free, no virus, easy mod installation, can use offline accounts(cracks).
