--DESCRIPTION--
reverse engineered how curseforge handel file downloads, usually you have to download the 500 Mb enormous app just to install an mod pack, that has .json and .html. 
well now, time has changed, no more storage stealing from curseforge, and time wasting from curseforge, you can now insta(not insta, but FASTLY) download the mods
inside the modpack and add them to your minecraft. 

--HOW TO USE--
type in "python3 curseforge.py" and hit enter
type in the name of your modpack folder (make sure the modpack folder is on the same directory as the script) then hit enter
IF EVERYTHING IS CORRECT, you should see a tinker window popup with the information about the game version, fabric forge information and other stuff along with it, 
(this is important because you want to install the same version of the fabric or forge your modpack is in for your minecraft instance). 
TO START THE DOWNLOAD, CLOSE THE TINKER WINDOW BY HITTING THE "X" BUTTON.
ALL THE MODS ARE INSTALLED IN A FOLDER NAMED "MODS" OR "mods"(depends), and then all you have to do is wait untill the program stops and quits.

--WHICH MINECRAFT LAUNCHER TO USE--
i personnaly recommend multimc, its free, no virus, easy mod installation, can use offline accounts(cracks)
